This project is working on getting Mark Drela's Fortran analysis programs
working on Mac, Linux, and Windows. Initially all of this code will require X11
suport, but I intend to factor out the user interface parts of this code and
replace them with an integrated Python front end. Much of this work has already
been done by others, but I am focusing on creating tools model builders can use
more comveniently.
